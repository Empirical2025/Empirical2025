A reasonably experienced Django engineer can infer that all custom SQLite functions must be wrapped with a guard that returns None when inputs are NULL (for example, by adding a decorator in django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py), but they must discover this by exploring the codebase rather than from the issue description alone.",2,"Although the high-level fix (guard against NULL arguments in custom SQLite functions) is conceptually straightforward, implementing it requires understanding the Django DB backend registration, modifying multiple files (sqlite3/base.py, datetime.py, text.py, and updating many function registrations), defining a reusable decorator, and adding corresponding tests. Familiarizing oneself with the backend architecture and making consistent changes across numerous functions would take an experienced engineer 1–4 hours.",0,,4

However, the issue does not specify exactly which CI files (e.g. GitHub Actions workflows, Travis, Appveyor, tox.ini) or source files (version guards in setup.py, __init__.py, scripts) need updates. It leaves room for interpretation about the full scope of changes (only CI, or also bumping python_requires and removing 3.6-specific code). As a result, some investigation of the repository’s CI configuration and version checks is required to produce a complete solution, but there is a sensible interpretation of what a successful fix entails.",2,"Dropping a Python version from CI and updating compatibility guards is more than a single-line tweak but does not require a deep algorithmic change.

Editing several files and ensuring tests pass would take on the order of 1–4 hours once familiar with the repository structure.",0,No additional blocking issues; the change is well within normal refactoring of CI and compatibility code and tests.,4

It is clear that the solution must expose a way to set or change the language tag (for example via a Feed class attribute) instead of the fixed setting. However, the description does not spell out the exact extension point or API contract for specifying the override, so an engineer must inspect the Feed class to choose where to add a new attribute and fallback logic. Overall, there is a sensible interpretation of the required change but some blanks remain around implementation details.",1,"Modifying the Feed class to add an optional language attribute, adjusting the get_feed method to use that attribute or fallback to settings, and importing get_language requires a bit of code navigation and understanding of Django’s syndication framework. The change itself spans only a few lines in one module and is straightforward once the correct insertion point is found. An experienced Django engineer could complete this in under an hour.",0,"No further blockers are evident. The provided issue text combined with the existing test suite would guide the implementer to the relevant code. The only minor hurdle is locating the hardcoded settings.LANGUAGE_CODE call, which is quickly achieved by searching the Feed class. There are no complex side effects or interactions with other parts of the codebase that would complicate this change.",4
